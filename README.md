### About Me

I'm currently on the Platform Engineering team at Kochava where we focus on mobile advertising analytics! I mainly work on Go applications and the infrastructure that supports them, typically Kubernetes. I'm also an avid homelabber, running my own 7-node Talos Linux (Kubernetes) cluster, Dell R620's, and UniFi networking. I run a number of applications, including [lfpweather.com](https://lfpweather.com), the frontend supporting my Davis Vantage Pro 2 Plus weather station!

Please check out my other organizations:

- [AlpineWorks](https://github.com/alpineworks) where I write many of my Go libraries and Helm Charts
- [searchandrescuegg](https://github.com/searchandrescuegg) where I develop tools and systems for use in search and rescue services
